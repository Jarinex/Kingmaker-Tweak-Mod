# Kingmaker-Tweak-Mod
A Pathfinder: Kingmaker mod that makes enemies more interesting

Tweak Mod is a mod for Pathfinder: Kingmaker that is designed to give challenge to the game. Inspired by Holic75’s “Kingmaker AI” mod, the mod is designed to shake encounters up by giving enemies more levels while also giving them new feats, abilities and spells!
I’ve always enjoyed challenge mods like SCS that people have made, and I feel that Kingmaker could definitely benefit from such a mod. Originally, Tweak Mod was designed for my own use, but I’ve really enjoyed messing with the game and improving it. Therefore, I would like others to try it as well and enjoy it.

NOTE: This mod is a work in progress and very early stage! A lot of what is shown here is subject to change! I will try and get to as many encounters as I can, but I don’t know if I will get to everything. If you have any ideas, I am open! 
I should also point out that I have only played with Turn-Based mod and haven’t tested this with the original RTwP.

THIS MOD REQUIRES CALL OF THE WILD BY HOLIC75!

Special Thanks:
Holic75 for his original KingmakerAI mod, which was the basis for this mod (and tries to do similar things). Some of the AI changes from his mod are in Tweak.
Spacehamster for major assistance in this mod. Without his help, I think the mod would have fallen apart completely. He helped me through a lot of issues!
Kingmaker Discord for being friendly and helpful 
Owlcat for the game itself!
