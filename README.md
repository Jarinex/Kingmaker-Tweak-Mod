# Stolen-Land-Encounters


Stolen Land Encounters is a mod for Pathfinder: Kingmaker that changes encounters to be more unique and slightly more challenging. The mod gives old enemies new tricks (including combat feats, new spells, new abilities) and adds some new enemies!


Requirements: ***This mod requires COTW by Holic75***. It also requires a file that is within the download called JMMT (or Jarinex Monster Mash Test), which was made by Hambeard. This file allows the copying and swapping of enemies in specific maps to new guids which can be edited. It will be included with the releases of this mod, but the source code can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Jarinex/JMMTBeta

Compatability: This mod should be compatable with most up to date mods. The mod will work with Holic75's "Kingmaker Ai" mod, as it will load before it. However, any changes that Kingmaker AI mod will overwrite what I have done. I also did not balance my mod with it in mind, so if you want to use it (and proper flanking) then you may find it too easy or too hard (not sure which).

F.A.Q (Or at least questions I expect)

***How far does thid mod go in terms of content?***

I have changed encounters and enemies from starting from chapter 1 to up to chapter 4 (after Armag) in terms of content. 

***Will you finish the rest of the game?***

YES ABSOLUTELY! I plan on working through the main parts of the game and changing them around

***Will you edit other parts of the game?***

I have plans to edit the magical prison encounters with some new unique enemies and fights. Perhaps there will even be new treasures to get :)
However, this will likely happen after I complete the main storyline.

***Will you edit companion quests?***

I have yet to decide on what I want to do with companion quests. While I would be happy to, I feel some people might be annoyed to be forced
to use companions they dont normally use. As such, I will not edit those for the time being

***What difficulty is this meant to be played on?***

Honestly, it can be played on any difficulty. My settings include unfair without the 2x damage, but you can play it however you want!

***This mod is too easy! I thought you wanted a challenge mod?***

While i wanted to increase the challenge of this mod, I tried to be somewhat fair. However, some may find it still too easy. I dont intend this to be
the ultimate challenge, but rather just a way to make the game more interesting. I can suggest either increasing the difficult further or increasing 
enemy health with bag of tricks (which is what I do).

***Is the source code available? I would like to see it.***

Certainly. Here is a github link: https://github.com/Jarinex/Stolen-Land-Encounters Also feel free to check out Holics kingmaker AI mod, as it was the base
for my mod:https://github.com/Holic75/KingmakerAi/

***Is this mod for RTwP or Turn-based mode***

I have only played this mod in turnbased mode, but I have a good feeling it will work with RTwP.

***Why do some enemies have quicken?***

In order to get buffs more quickly on enemies (casters), I gave them quicken so they can buff themselves quickly. While I can put a buff on them manaully, it 
doesnt scale to their caster level. As such, they can be easily dispelled. I didn't want that to happen, so I gave casters quicken to get those spells out
more quickly. 

***Will you make a version for Wrath of The Righteous?***

Ideally, yes, but I can't make any promises. These mods take a lot of time, and I'm not sure how modding will work for Wrath.

***Will you continue working on this mod after Wrath releases?***

Yes, I will at least get a working version for the mod out. I don't know if it will be done before Wrath, but we will see.

Special Thanks:
Holic75 for his original KingmakerAI mod, which was the framework for this mod (and tries to do similar things). 
Spacehamster for major assistance in this mod. Without his help, I think the mod would have fallen apart completely. He helped me through a lot of issues!
Hambeard for his help with JMMT, which has opened all kinds of possibilities and changes with this mod!
Testers: Chen, Rotani, Smooge and Endarire for their feedback!
